# Linked Lists

A linked list is a common data structure of one or more nodes. Each node contains a value and a pointer to the 
previous/next node forming the chain-like structure. Nodes are stored randomly in the system's memory, which
improves the space complexity compared to the array.

### Pointers
A pointer is an object that stores a memory address.


## Time Complexity 
| Syntax  | Average Case |
|---------|--------------|
| Prepend | O(1)         |
| Append  | O(1)         |
| Lookup  | O(n)         |
| Insert  | O(n)         |
| Delete  | O(n)         |



## Space Complexity
- Worst case O(n)


### Singly Linked Lists:

- SSL is a linear DS comprising of nodes chained together in a single direction.
- Only traverses forward.


### Doubly Linked Lists:

- DLL contains a pointer to the next node as well as the previous node.
- List can be traversed in both directions


### Good at:
- Fast insertion
- Fast deletion
- Ordered
- Flexible size

### Bad at:
- Slow lookup
- More memory
