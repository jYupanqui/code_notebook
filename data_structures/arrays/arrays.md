# Arrays

An Array is a collection of items of some data type stored at contiguous (one after another) memory locations.

## Time Complexity 
| Syntax    | Average Case |
|-----------|--------------|
| Access    | O(1)         |
| Search    | O(n)         |
| Insertion | O(n)         |
| Deletion  | O(n)         |



## Space Complexity
- Worst case O(n)


### Static Arrays:
- Size or number of elements in static array is fixed
- Arrays content can be modified, but the memory space allocated to it remains constant.

### Dynamic Arrays
- Size or number of elements in a dynamic arrays can change.
- Dynamic arrays allow elements to be added and removed at the run time.


### Good at:
- Fast lookups
- Fast push/pop
- Ordered

### Bad at:
- Slow inserts
- Slow deletes
- Fixed size (using static array)
