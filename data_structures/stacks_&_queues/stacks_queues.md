# Stacks

Stack is a linear data structure in which the element inserted las is the element 
to be deleted first.
**Last In First Out (LIFO)**

## Time Complexity 
| Syntax   | Average Case |
|----------|--------------|
| Push     | O(1)         |
| Peek     | O(n)         |
| pop      | O(1)         |


# Queues

Queue is another DS that places elements in a sequence, similar to a stack. A queue uses the FIFO method
**(First In First Out)** by which the first element that is enqueue will be the first one to be dequeue.


## Time Complexity 
| Syntax  | Average Case |
|---------|--------------|
| enqueue | O(1)         |
| dequeue | O(1)         |
| peek    | O(1)         |
| isempty | O(1)         |

### Stacks and Queues Good at :
- Fast Operations
- Fast Peek
- Ordered


### Stacks and Queues Bad at :
- Slow Lookup
